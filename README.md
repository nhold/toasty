### Code Standards

Argument in class methods should just be the name, use this-> to differentiate between them. E.g `this->health = health`. No m\a prefixes to member variables.

### Code Structure

The entry point is in `main.cpp` but it just calls and uses `TD` found in `td.hpp\td.cpp` which inherits from `Game` found in `game.hpp\game.cpp`. The game is split into states:

* `menustate.hpp\cpp` - This renders\updates the menu
* `gamestate.hpp\cpp` - This renders\updates the game, the update is in a seperate method that is run on different thread
* `tileeditorstate.hpp\cpp` - This renders\updates the tile editor.
